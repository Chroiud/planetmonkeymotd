Sorry for the inconvienence, but the mod menu is moderator only. I accidentally enabled it for everyone, but since you guys liked it so much I created 2 purchases. You can purchase a mod menu (not as good but still good) and a grappling hook. This will be able to help me run better servers, thank you.

Check out level 2 of horror. It is now officially released!
